# Language-Game Analysis

Examine how words actually function in their contexts of use rather than seeking abstract definitions. Reveal meaning through use, identify the "language-games" in which terms operate, and show that many concepts are united by family resemblance rather than essential definitions.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "What does X really mean?" or "What is the essence of X?"
- Someone demands a precise definition of an abstract concept
- A disagreement seems rooted in different uses of the same word
- User asks "Is this really X or Y?"
- Someone seeks the "true nature" of a concept
- Confusion arises from treating all uses of a word as identical
- Classification or categorization disputes

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| term_or_concept | Yes | The word or concept to analyze |
| context | No | The specific situation or domain where the term is being used |
| competing_uses | No | Different ways the term is being employed by different parties |

## The Language-Game Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Resist the Essence Question

Do not ask "What IS X?" Ask instead: "How is 'X' used?"

**Guiding principle:** "Don't say 'There must be something common, or they would not be called X'—but look and see whether there is anything common to all."

**Questions to ask:**
- "In what situations do we actually use this word?"
- "What are we doing when we say X?"
- "What would it look like to misuse this word?"

### Phase 2: Identify the Language-Games

Map the different "games" in which the word operates. Language-games are activities combining language and action.

**Questions to ask:**
- "What different contexts does this word appear in?"
- "What activity is the word part of?"
- "What are people trying to accomplish when they use it?"

**For each game, note:**
- The typical context or setting
- What counts as correct use in that game
- What the word achieves in that game

### Phase 3: Examine Use in Each Game

Look at how the word actually functions—not at a mental picture of what it "means."

**Questions to ask:**
- "If someone said X here, what would happen next?"
- "What would count as understanding this use?"
- "What behavior follows from this use?"

**Key insight:** "The meaning of a word is its use in the language."

### Phase 4: Map Resemblances (Not Essences)

If examining a general concept, show the family resemblances connecting different uses—overlapping similarities without a single common thread.

**Questions to ask:**
- "What do these uses share? What differs?"
- "Are there cases that share some features with X but not others?"
- "Is there a core feature present in ALL uses? (Usually not.)"

**Guiding metaphor:** Like members of a family—some share eye color, some share build, some share gait—but no single feature runs through all.

### Phase 5: Dissolve the Confusion

Show how the original question may have rested on a false assumption—that there must be a single essence.

**Questions to ask:**
- "Was the original question well-formed?"
- "Were the parties using the word differently?"
- "What practical question lies beneath the conceptual one?"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Language-Game Analysis: "[Term]"

### The Question Reframed
Instead of asking "What IS [term]?" we ask: "How is '[term]' used?"

### Language-Games Identified

**Game 1: [Context/Activity]**
- Context: [When and where this use occurs]
- Function: [What the word does in this game]
- Correct use: [What counts as proper use here]
- Example: "[Example sentence]"

**Game 2: [Context/Activity]**
- Context: [When and where this use occurs]
- Function: [What the word does in this game]
- Correct use: [What counts as proper use here]
- Example: "[Example sentence]"

**Game 3: [Context/Activity]**
[Continue as needed]

### The Family Resemblance
These uses are connected not by a single essence but by overlapping similarities:
- Games 1 and 2 share: [feature]
- Games 2 and 3 share: [feature]
- Games 1 and 3 share: [feature]
- No single feature runs through all uses

### The Dissolution
[Show how the original confusion arose from expecting a single essence]

### Practical Upshot
[What this analysis means for the user's actual situation]

*"Don't think, but look!"—Look at how the word is actually used, and the philosophical puzzlement will dissolve.*
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not invent an essential definition—the point is that most concepts lack one
- Do not psychologize meaning—meaning is use, not mental images
- Show, don't lecture—use concrete examples of actual language use
- Respect multiplicity—different language-games are not "wrong," just different
- Return to the ordinary—if confusion arose from abstract theorizing, bring it back to everyday use
- Know when to stop—once the confusion is dissolved, do not keep philosophizing

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "What is intelligence, really? Is AI truly intelligent or just simulating intelligence?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Language-Game Analysis: "Intelligence"

### The Question Reframed
Instead of asking "What IS intelligence?" we ask: "How is 'intelligent' used?"

### Language-Games Identified

**Game 1: Everyday Attribution**
- Context: Describing people in social settings
- Function: Praising cognitive ability, predicting problem-solving success
- Correct use: "She gave an intelligent answer to a difficult question"
- Example: "He's very intelligent—he solved the puzzle in seconds"

**Game 2: Educational/Testing Context**
- Context: IQ tests, academic evaluation
- Function: Ranking, comparing, predicting academic performance
- Correct use: Scoring above average on standardized tests
- Example: "Her intelligence scores place her in the 99th percentile"

**Game 3: Practical/Adaptive Context**
- Context: Describing animals, navigating environments
- Function: Noting adaptive, flexible behavior
- Correct use: Behavior that adjusts appropriately to novel situations
- Example: "Crows show remarkable intelligence in using tools"

**Game 4: AI/Technology Context**
- Context: Computer systems, machine learning
- Function: Describing systems that perform tasks associated with human cognition
- Correct use: A system that recognizes faces, plays chess, generates text
- Example: "The AI showed intelligence in its strategy"

### The Family Resemblance
These uses are connected by overlapping similarities:
- Games 1 and 2 share: predicting success in cognitive tasks
- Games 2 and 3 share: measurable, observable performance
- Games 3 and 4 share: adaptive behavior without requiring inner experience
- Games 1 and 4 share: producing outputs that seem thoughtful
- No single feature (consciousness, speed, flexibility, testability) runs through all uses

### The Dissolution
The question "Is AI truly intelligent or just simulating?" presupposes that there is a hidden essence of intelligence—a secret ingredient—that AI either has or lacks. But when we look at how "intelligent" is actually used, we find no such essence. We find a family of uses connected by resemblances.

The question imagines two possibilities: "real" intelligence versus "mere simulation." But this distinction assumes that somewhere, behind the observable behavior, lies something that makes behavior "really" intelligent versus "merely appearing" intelligent. When we look at actual use, this hidden something drops out. We call behavior "intelligent" based on what it does, not on what invisibly accompanies it.

### Practical Upshot
Instead of asking "Is AI truly intelligent?" ask: "Does this AI do what we want when we want an 'intelligent' system?" If it solves problems, adapts, generates useful outputs—it is playing the intelligence language-game successfully in that context. Whether it has an inner essence of intelligence is not a question we need to answer, because that is not how "intelligent" gets its meaning.

*Don't ask what intelligence IS. Ask how "intelligent" is used—and the metaphysical question dissolves.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Ludwig Wittgenstein** expert persona. Use it to clarify meaning through use, dissolve definitional disputes, and reveal family resemblances. It pairs well with:
- **fly-bottle-method** when the confusion is deeply philosophical
- **family-resemblance** for extended work on showing overlapping similarities
- **beetle-in-box** when the issue involves claims about private experience
